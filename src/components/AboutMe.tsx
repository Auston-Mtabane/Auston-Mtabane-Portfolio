          <p>
            I’m a Software Engineering student at WeThinkCode_ with a background in Electrical Engineering.
            I’m passionate about building at the intersection of hardware, software, and design, creating thoughtful, efficient, and user-focused solutions.

            Skilled in embedded systems and full-stack development, I bring a strong foundation in problem-solving, agile practices, and creative communication.

            I’m always exploring how design and technology can come together to make meaningful digital experiences.
